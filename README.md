A Win32 module that once injected into Spotify, can download songs directly from Spotify servers regardless whether or not you're listening to them.

Most of the functions come from meik97's XSpotify project (huge shoutouts to him and also fortender and pr8x for helping), but I have tried to readapt the software in order for it to have it's own little GUI.
